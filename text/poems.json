            The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br/>
            Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br/>
            Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br/>
            The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br/>
            The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br/>
            The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br/>   
            Are full of passionate intensity.<br/>
            <br/>
            Surely some revelation is at hand;<br/>
            Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br/>
            The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br/>   
            When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br/>
            Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br/>   
            A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br/>   
            A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br/>   
            Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br/>   
            Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br/>
            The darkness drops again; but now I know<br/>
            That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br/>
            Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br/>
            And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br/>
            Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<br/>

                    She carries in the dishes,
                    And lays them in a row.
                    To an isle in the water
                    With her would I go.
                    
                    She carries in the candles,
                    And lights the curtained room,
                    Shy in the doorway
                    And shy in the gloom;
                    
                    And shy as a rabbit,
                    Helpful and shy.
                    To an isle in the water
                    With her would I fly."
