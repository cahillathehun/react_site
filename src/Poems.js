                <br/>
                <p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre<br/>   
                    The falcon cannot hear the falconer;<br/>
                    Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;<br/>
                    Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,<br/>
                    The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere<br/>
                    The ceremony of innocence is drowned;<br/>
                    The best lack all conviction, while the worst<br/>   
                    Are full of passionate intensity.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Surely some revelation is at hand;<br/>
                    Surely the Second Coming is at hand.<br/>
                    The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out<br/>   
                    When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi<br/>
                    Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert<br/>   
                    A shape with lion body and the head of a man,<br/>   
                    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,<br/>   
                    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it<br/>   
                    Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.<br/>
                    The darkness drops again; but now I know<br/>
                    That twenty centuries of stony sleep<br/>
                    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,<br/>
                    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,<br/>
                    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?<br/>
                </p>
